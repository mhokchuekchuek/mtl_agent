## **🔀 Single-Turn vs Multi-Turn**

| Type | Description | Thread ID |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Single-turn | One question, one response | New UUID per test |
| Multi-turn | Multiple turns in sequence | Same UUID for all turns |


### 🔄 **Multi-Turn Flow**

</details>

Each turn is evaluated separately, scores are aggregated.

## **⚖️ Judge Selection**

Judges are selected based on `expected` fields in test case:

| Expected Field | Judge Activated |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `sql` | SQLJudge |
| `search_results` | SearchJudge |
| `chart` | VisualizationJudge |
| `response_quality` | ResponseQualityJudge |

> 📝 **Note:** If expected field is missing, judge returns `None` (skipped).


---


## **❌ Negative Cases**

For negative test cases:
- `sql: "null"` → Pass if no SQL generated
- `search_results: []` → Pass if no results found
- `chart: "null"` → Pass if no chart generated
